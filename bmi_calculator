//Create your function below this line.

function bmiCalculator(weight,height){

    var bmi = weight/(height*height);
    return bmi
}

//The first parameter should be the weight and the second should be the height.




// If my weight is 65Kg and my height is 1.8m, I should be able to call your function like this:

var bmi = bmiCalculator(65, 1.8); 
console.log (bmi);

//bmi should equal 20 when it's rounded to the nearest whole number.
